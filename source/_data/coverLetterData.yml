paragraph1: "Please accept this letter as an expression of my interest in the Software Engineer position. I am a highly
            motivated and progress-focused Software Developer with a wonderful background in this industry. With a
            track record of initiative and dependability, I have devised strategic initiatives which I believe will prove

paragraph2: "I joined and completed a program that teaches you how to code called Persevere, I've completed and
            received certificates with the online course of 'Responsive Web Design', 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data
            Structures', and 'Front-End Development Libraries' through freeCodeCamp.org. As well as received
            certificates from the online course 'Spring Boot for Beginners' and 'Captivate In Action, Creating a Tabs
            Interaction' through Udemy.com.  I received 'on the job' training with Banyan Labs where I received more
            training, experience, and was able to develop from my title as a jr. software developer to a software
            developer. Banyan Labs partnered with the Indeed company who took a team of new developers, me
            included, and started a website project which Indeed continues to use. Throughout the course of my
            career, I have and am willing to continually grow my software development and programming abilities. I
            am a capable and consistent problem-solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with
            proficiency."

            and business improvements. I am progressive minded and in tune with new developments in my field. I
            have proven to be effective and collaborative with strong problem-solving talents. I enjoy collective
            brainstorming sessions to coordinate activities and achieve a common goal."
