# About me varibles
aboutMe01: "I am a software developer and I enjoy reading fantasy books, watching anime, and coding. I joined and completed a program that teaches you how to code called Persevere, I've completed and received certificates with the online course of “Responsive Web Design”, “JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures”, and “Front-End Development Libraries” through freeCodeCamp. As well as received certificates from the online course “Spring Boot for Beginners” and “Captivate In Action: Creating a Tabs Interaction” through Udemy. Through these courses and classes, I was able to start the career that I love and gives me purpose."
aboutMe02: "Persevere was the start of my title as a jr. software developer. I received the knowledge 
            and skill of Frontend development that started with the freeCodeCamp sources. Persevere also 
            started my 'on the job' training with Banyan Labs where I received more training, experience, and 
            was able to develop from my title as a jr. software developer to a software developer. Banyan Labs 
            partnered with the Indeed company who took a team of new developers, me included, and started 
            a website project which Indeed continues to use. This opened a whole new environment of coding 
            knowledge and a good way to apply that knowledge. I was introduced to the Backend aspect of
            coding, which started me on my way to becoming a full stack developer.
            My time with Banyan Labs concluded after the Indeed application was up and running. I 
            am currently enrolled in a python learning program through Columbia University called “Justice 
            through Code”."

aboutMe03: "I am studying the usage of the coding language known as python as well as the 
            usage of the python web framework known as Django. My teamwork, communication, and coding 
            skills continue to grow day by day. There are much easier and simpler paths that I could take but 
            I choose to stay on this path because of how challenging it is, no matter how much I accomplish 
            there will always be another level to climb, another coding method or language to learn. That is 
            what keeps my passion for coding extraordinary"
